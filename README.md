# MNIST Number Guesser
This program uses a basic neural network, MNIST data set, and pygame to allow users to draw numbers on the screen. The program will guess the number that the user has drawn.

Run the program from the DrawNumber.py file. To generate a neural network model run the CreateModel.py file, a model is already included for you however. Hold left mouse to draw, space to guess the number, and backspace to clear the screen.
